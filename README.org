A ConceptMap authoring tool powered by Emacs.

Create concept maps with Emacs. Choose a main node and connect it to other nodes with links. Each node has a local graph of connected concepts. The whole graph is shown as an image.

The graph data is saved in Elisp format and converted to graphviz dot file for visualization.
